					<h1>Books</h1>
					<p>Reading is fun, it's a challenge, and it's a personal choice. Whether I wanted to read or not depended on the situation, but I began to appreciate it at a young age. I adored literature and enjoyed leisure reading. I had to complete a book on the same day I started it once I got into it.I would reach for another book after finishing one, usually by the same author. My interest in literature had sparked with picture books, not out of nowhere.</p>

					<h1>Gaming</h1>
					<p>The Passion for the Game Currently, video games are a part of practically every child's life. Video games are ingrained in modern culture and have a long-term impact.I love to play video games. I play PUBG. I'm a tier 1 player. I've my team ,Iplay with them. On the other hand, there are others who believe that video games effectively support childrenâ€™s learning.  Educational video games offer children endless options and change the way students are learning. </p>

					<h1>Painting</h1>
					<p>The Artwork "A picture is worth a thousand words," they say. I discovered the one image in my head that is worth a thousand words and more. I noticed this photo in the writing center a few of weeks ago; the writing center is part of State College. The vibrant hues drew my attention. I became so enthralled by the art that I lost track of my companions.When I first heard about the observation essay, I was excited because it required us to write about a person or thing in the city that caught our attention.</p>
