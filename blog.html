				<h1>Effect of Technology in our daily lives</h1>
				<br>
				<p>Innumerable ways have modern technology changed our lives, revolutionizing how we work, live, and play. In many American homes as early as the 1990s, televisions were the pinnacle of technology. In 1989, only 15% of homes had a personal machine, according to the Census Bureau. By 2011, the percentage had risen to 75%.Owing to the abundance of emails, video conferencing, tablets, and computers, modern offices will be unrecognizable to staff of the past.</p>
				<br>
				<h4>Communication</h4>
				<p>The field of communication is one of the fields where technology has had the most effects. It used to be difficult to communicate with people who were not in your immediate vicinity; it required physical letters and a lot of patience. For the majority of the twentieth century, professional correspondence entailed letter writing, faxing, or talking on the phone for hours at a time. That is no longer the case. In today's workplace, email has become the predominant form of business communication.</p>
				<br>
				<h4>Education</h4>
				<p>Lectures and lessons in written or video format can be posted to websites, making material more available. The World Wide Web makes all of the knowledge you need available and accessible 24 hours a day. Computers and the Internet have changed the way we learn. Computers can store massive quantities of data in a limited amount of space, reducing entire libraries of reference books to a single flash drive. They allow for better knowledge presentation, making the teaching process easier and more efficient. People all over the world now have access to unparalleled learning opportunities thanks to online education.</p>
				<br>
				<h4>Health</h4>
				<p>The healthcare sector has been greatly influenced by technological advancements. Diagnostic techniques have improved, allowing physicians to detect health conditions earlier, increasing the chances of effective life-saving treatments. Vaccines have been extremely successful, virtually eliminating diseases like measles, diphtheria, and smallpox, which used to cause major epidemics. Patients can now treat chronic diseases that were once crippling and life-threatening, such as diabetes and hypertension, thanks to modern medicine. Medical progress has extended people's lives and enhanced their quality of life all over the world.</p>
				<br>
				<h4>Productivity</h4>
				<p>Since computers' ability to solve complex mathematical equations has enabled them to speed up virtually any job, technology has vastly increased productivity. Engineers may use computer modeling to simulate structures, vehicles, and materials to get performance data before prototyping. The ability of networked machines to exchange and manage data in the office will speed up a variety of activities, allowing workers to function more effectively and productively. Agriculture has benefited from technological advances, which has improved food production. Sensitive time-consuming processes can now be completed with ease in many aspects of our lives â€“ only in a fraction of the time they once took.</p>
				<br>
				<p>However, Technology has affectefd 90% of our daily activities.Now the world has became a small global village due to technologies.We can reach to every corner of world in certain period of time. we are able to communicate with the people who is very far away from one another.Thus, the technology has negative impacts too,that we are being lazy day by day physically .</p>
